	Belatedly starting digital notes for analyzing the 2008 data. 
		- processPhils2012-05-07.R
		- Modify to add lat/long for every anemone. 
		- output GPSSurvey.anemlatlong2012-05-07.csv
		- re-format manually: GPSSurvey.anemlatlong2012-05-07 for GPSBabel.csv
			- deleted any rows that lat/lon = NA (could dig deeper, but not worth it right now. I figured out approximations for some of these in 2008, see script)
		- GPSBabel outputs GPSSurvey.anemlatlong2012-05-07.kml
		- Added to Google Earth as 2008 anemones (white dots)
